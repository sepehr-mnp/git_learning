What are the git directory and the working tree?


The git directory stores configuration settings and the working tree stores the history of the files.


The git directory is copied to the computer and the working tree stays in the remote repository.


The git directory is a sandbox for changing the files and the working tree contains old versions of the files.


correct -> The git directory contains all the changes and their history and the working tree contains the current versions of the files.
